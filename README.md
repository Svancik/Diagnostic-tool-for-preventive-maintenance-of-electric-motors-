# Diagnostic-tool-for-preventive-maintenance-of-electric-motors-
This thesis focuses on web app development for diagnostics tool which monitors operation of 3 phase asynchronous electric motor in the paper mill. The data will be collected through single board computer  Arduino and its sensors. The sensors will collect temperature data, vibration data and elecrical current data. The tool will predict failure of elctric motor based on alarms. The data will be visualized and evaulated in graphical user interface. If the monitored data will surpass threshold which threatens the lifetime of electric motor, the tool will imideately send notification to the resonpsible person for operation of electric motor.
